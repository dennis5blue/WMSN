In this paper, we exploit the overhearing source coding in the wireless
multimedia sensor networks (WMSN).
Since the image collected from cameras deployed around a small area is often
correlated, we can reduce the required encoded bits of the network by using a
dependent source coding scheme.
However, in order to serve the network in a more efficient way, we formulate a
transmission scheduling problem in this paper.
Our problem is for choosing which multimedia sensor as a former transmitter so
that the later scheduled sensors can reference from it to reduce their
encoded bits.
Experiment results show that the total encoded bits needed for collecting data
can be reduced under this coding scheme, and thus motivate further investigation
in this topic.
