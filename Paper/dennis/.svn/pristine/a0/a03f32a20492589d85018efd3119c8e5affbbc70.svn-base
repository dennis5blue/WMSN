Reducing the demand of radio resource usage in wireless surveillance networks
has recently caught much attention in various research areas.
For example, the spatial correlation between cameras gives the surveillance
networks leverage to reduce the total amount of encoded bits for transmission.
The authors in~\cite{SpatialCorrelationModel} proposed a spatial correlation
model for cameras deployed in a neighborhood area.
In their model, the correlation of two cameras are determined by their
location and the difference of their sensing direction.
However, the camera views are more complicated so that the correlation cannot
be determined only by its geometric characteristic.
Hence, in order to provide a more realistic model, the work
in~\cite{RealisticModel} gives an investigation of the relation among cameras
through a multiview video coding software.
They analyzed the performance of H.264 multiview video coding of multiple
cameras and showed that the coding cost of two cameras raises as their angular
difference become larger.

One way to deal with the resource reduction problem is through the distributed
video coding~\cite{DVC}, which is based on the Slepian-Wolf's and Wyner-Ziv's
coding theorem.
Distributed video coding is different from the conventional video coding scheme
at both the encoder and decoder.
More specifically, it suggests an encoder encodes individual frames
independently, but the decoder decodes them jointly, which means that the
previous frames are used as a side information at the decoder only.
The authors in~\cite{DVCinMVC} extended the idea of distributed video coding
into multiview systems with spatial correlation among cameras. 
In their work, side information can be generated by exploiting the spatial
correlation and redundancies between different camera's views while the decoder
has the complexity to decode those frames jointly.  
Our work, on the other hand, does not require the decoder to have so much
complexity.
We focus on an overhearing source coding scheme.
That is, each cameras has the possibility to overhear other cameras' frame so
that it can provide inter-frame processing to reduce its encoded bits.

The work in~\cite{MLS} considered overhearing in the wireless multimedia
sensor networks.
They made use of the model proposed in~\cite{SpatialCorrelationModel} and
solved a relaxed integer programming problem to determine a proper schedule for
reducing the most encoded bits.
In this paper, we define a more realistic correlation model and exploit a
\emph{correlation-aware scheduling algorithm} to achieve the same goal as the
optimization problem in~\cite{MLS}.
Simulation result will show that our proposed algorithm can have a better
performance than solving the relaxed optimization problem.
